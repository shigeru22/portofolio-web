        Just a guy of nothing. Really.<br /><br />
        I'm Jeremy Yonathan, mostly known as my usual nickname Shigeru. Currently majoring in Informatics
        at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara.<br />
        I'm highly passionate in developing and learning about technology. Most commonly in .NET (C#)
        including Unity and WPF, and web applications using PHP and Node.js.<br />
        You may contact me using the links in the footer below. Either to say hi, or just for a random
        chit-chat!<br /><br />
        <small>*Note that I'm actually hard at communication though. :]</small>
